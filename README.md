I am a Full-Stack software engineer with 9 years of experience, specializing in the Web3 industry. Recently, I made the exciting transition from Web2 to Web3 due to my deep passion for decentralized technologies. Within my Github profile, you will find a diverse range of projects showcasing my expertise in smart contract development (Solidity), front-end development using React, Next.js, and more.

One of my key strengths lies in my solid foundation as a Certified Solidity Developer, accredited by the Blockchain Council in August 2022. This certification attests to my proficiency in creating secure and efficient smart contracts, enabling me to build robust decentralized applications. Additionally, my certification as a Certified Blockchain Security Expert by 101 Blockchains in July 2022 demonstrates my dedication to ensuring the utmost security and reliability in Web3 ecosystems.
